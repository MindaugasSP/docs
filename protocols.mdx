# Protocols

Residential Proxy Support for HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 Formats

The connection protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5) can be specified in the tool or program you're using to connect with the proxies.

In the following `cURL` examples, the protocol is specified at the beginning of the proxy line, just replace the `username` and `password` with your proxy user credentials, and run them in your Terminal or Command Prompt.

## HTTP

Here is a `cURL` example for the `HTTP` protocol:

```curl cURL
curl -x "http://username:password@gate.decodo.com:7000" "https://ip.decodo.com/json"
```

## HTTPS

Using this protocol will **encrypt** your connection. Here is a `cURL` example for the `HTTPS` protocol:

```curl
curl -x "https://username:password@gate.decodo.com:7000" "https://ip.decodo.com/json"
```

## SOCKS5

Here is a `cURL` command for the `SOCKS5` protocol:

```curl cURL
curl -x "socks5h://user-username-session-1:password@gate.decodo.com:7000" "https://ip.decodo.com/json"
```

  The letter `h` in `socks5h://` means that the hostname will be resolved on the proxy side, and not locally.
</Callout>

> 🚧 Country Endpoint Support
>
> Note that you have to use the `gate.decodo.com` endpoint to use `SOCKS5`. Country endpoints like `us.decodo.com` will not work!
>
> You can instead target specific locations by specifying the location using **[Advanced Parameters](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-advanced-parameters#/)**. For example, this `cURL` command targets the US location:
>
> ```curl cURL
> curl -U "user-username-country-us:password" -x "socks5h://gate.decodo.com:7000" "https://ip.decodo.com/json"
> ```

> 🚧 Tool Support
>
> * To get a sticky `SOCKS5` proxy in a **tool**, you must use a `session` parameter, otherwise, the proxy will always rotate even with a `sessionduration` parameter.
> * The **session ID** can be defined by any string of your choice. More on that can be found on the [**Advanced Parameters**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-advanced-parameters) page in the **Sticky session** section.

## Ports

Easily understand which ports you can access when using our proxies, including details on the default accessible ports, restrictions, and how to request a port to be unblocked.

### Accessible Ports

With the **residential** and **mobile** proxies, the following ports are accessible by default:

* `80`
* `443`

### Restricted Ports

Restricted ports include **`SMTP`**, **`IMAP`**, and other **mailing** and **messaging** related ports.

### Port Unblocking Process

To request for port unblock, contact us at [**compliance@decodo.com**](mailto:compliance@decodo.com) and provide the following information:

* The **port** that needs to be unblocked.
* Describe the **use case** with that port – **be as specific as possible**.
* Provide the **target** that you’ll access using the mentioned port.

For added security, particularly for requests involving sensitive or high-risk ports, we’ll require the user to provide **company details** or complete ID verification to complete the unblocking request.
