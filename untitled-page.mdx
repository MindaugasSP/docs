# Authentication Methods

Residential Proxy Authentication Methods

We support residential proxy authentication via username and password or IP-based whitelisting.

You can manage **proxy users** and **whitelisted IPs** on the [**Residential → Residential → Authentication**](https://dashboard.decodo.com/residential-proxies/authentication) section on your dashboard.

* After you purchase a plan or subscription, a proxy username and password will be automatically generated in the Authentication section.
* The default number of whitelisted IP slots is **10**. Please [**contact**](https://direct.lc.chat/12092754/1) our customer support for more information.
