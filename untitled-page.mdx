# Introduction

Web Scraping API: a Single API for Seamless, Scalable Data Extraction

The Decodo **Web Scraping API** provides fully managed web data extraction, handling proxies, browsers, CAPTCHAs, and anti-bot mechanisms so you can focus on utilizing the data.

Whether you need simple, high-volume requests or advanced configurations, our API offers two solutions:

* **Core**: cost-effective scraping for structured web data with minimal configuration.
* **Advanced**: fully customizable scraping with JavaScript rendering, pre-built templates, and structured data output.

## How it works

1. Start collecting data with the easy-to-use dashboard scraping solution:
   * Choose a target – select the website or data source you need to scrape from our extensive [**templates**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/web-scraping-api-targets#/) list or choose the universal Web target for any others, then type your URL.
   * Specify your [**parameters**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/web-scraping-api-parameters#/) – choose your JS rendering and parsing options and customize request parameters, such as language and location.
   * Use the built-in scraper – ready-made scraper handles proxies, browsers, and anti-bot bypassing automatically.
   * Receive clean data – get structured output in `HTML`, `JSON`, or `CSV` formats, ready for analysis.
   * You can copy `cURL`, `Python`, and `Node` examples straight from the dashboard Request Examples for easy integration.
2. Explore your usage [**statistics**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/web-scraping-api-statistics#/) in the Dashboard: see traffic breakdowns by domain, success rates, and hourly, daily, and monthly insights.
