Residential Proxy Quick Start

> 📘 Decodo Proxies Use Endpoints
>
> - Endpoints are like gateways to IP pools.
> - When you connect to an endpoint, your traffic is **automatically** routed through a random IP address from the Decodo IP pool.

- Residential proxies use the following endpoint and port for random requests:

```
gate.decodo.com:7000
```

- Here are a few basic request examples in various programming languages:

<CodeGroup>

```curl Curl
curl -U 'USERNAME:PASSWORD' -x gate.decodo.com:7000 https://ip.decodo.com/
```


```python Python
import requests
url = 'https://ip.decodo.com/json'
username = 'username'
password = 'password'
proxy = f"http://{username}:{password}@gate.decodo.com:7000"
result = requests.get(url, proxies = {
    'http': proxy,
    'https': proxy
})
print(result.text)
```


```node
const axios = require('axios');
const { HttpsProxyAgent } = require('https-proxy-agent');

const url = 'https://ip.decodo.com/json';
const proxyAgent = new HttpsProxyAgent(
  'http://username:password@gate.decodo.com:7000');

axios
  .get(url, {
    httpsAgent: proxyAgent,
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data);
  });
```


```php
<?php

      $url = 'ip.decodo.com/json';
      $proxy = 'gate.decodo.com';
      $port = 7000;
      $user = 'username';
      $psw = 'password';

      $ch = curl_init($url);
      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
      
      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_PROXY, "$proxy:$port");
      curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD, "$user:$psw");
      $result = curl_exec($ch);
      curl_close($ch);

      if ($result) {
        echo $result . PHP_EOL;
      }
```


```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "net/url"
)

   func main() {
     proxyUrl, err := url.Parse("http://username:password@gate.decodo.com:7000")
     if err != nil {
       log.Fatalln(err)
     }

     client := &http.Client{
       Transport: &http.Transport{Proxy: http.ProxyURL(proxyUrl)},
     }
     req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://ip.decodo.com/json", nil)
     if err != nil {
       log.Println(err)
     }

     res, err := client.Do(req)
     log.Println(res)

     if err != nil {
       log.Println(err)
     }
   }
```


```java
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ProxyTest
{
   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
   {
  	InetSocketAddress proxyAddress = new InetSocketAddress("gate.decodo.com", 7000); // Set proxy IP/port.
  	Proxy proxy = new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, proxyAddress);
  	URL url = new URI("https://ip.decodo.com/").toURL(); //enter target URL
  	Authenticator authenticator = new Authenticator() {
     	public PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
        	return (new PasswordAuthentication("username","password".toCharArray())); //enter credentials
     	}
  	};


  	Authenticator.setDefault(authenticator);
   URLConnection urlConnection = url.openConnection(proxy);


//Scanner to view output

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(urlConnection.getInputStream());
   System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());
   scanner.close();

   }
}
```

> 📘 Control Your Connection
>
> - You can make this more specific by changing the endpoints and ports or by adding parameters to control the IP selection.
> - Keep reading for a step-by-step walkthrough on specifying and generating more examples, or check out our [**Location**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-endpoints-and-ports/), and [**Advanced Parameters**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-advanced-parameters/) articles for an even more in-depth look.

## Authentication

1. First, navigate to the [**Residential → Proxy setup**](https://dashboard.decodo.com/residential-proxies/proxy-setup) page on your dashboard and look for the Authentication section.
   - You’ll see that your first proxy user and password are created automatically.
2. Next, select your proxy **authentication method**.
   - This can be either your **whitelisted IP** address or one of your **proxy users**.

> 📘 Additional Authentication Options
>
> <Steps>
>   <Step title="Copy password">
>     You may **copy** your password by clicking on it
>   </Step>
>   <Step title="View password">
>     To see the password click the **eye** icon.
>   </Step>
>   <Step title="Generate new password">
>     You can generate a new password by clicking on the **arrow icon** and choosing **Confirm**.
>   </Step>
>   <Step title="Manage traffic">
>     Here, you can also see the **used traffic** and **add a traffic limit** per proxy user, or check the used traffic sum of your whitelisted IPs.
>   </Step>
> </Steps>
>
> - You can further manage your credentials in the **Authentication** tab. For more details, check out the [**Authentication Methods**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-authentication-methods) article.

## Proxy Setup

In the Residential Proxy Setup section of your dashboard, selecting various parameters will generate examples you can easily copy into your applications, tools, or code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find parameter selection">
    On the [**Residential → Residential → Proxy setup**](https://dashboard.decodo.com/residential-proxies/proxy-setup) page, find the parameter selection section below your authentication methods.
  </Step>

### Location

  <Step title="Select location">
    First, select the [**Location**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-endpoints-and-ports) of your proxy.

> 📘 `Zip Code` Targeting
>
> - Available only when the **`USA`** `country` is selected; `Continent`, `State` or `City` options are unsupported.

> 📘 `ASN` Targeting
>
> - You can specify an **`ASN`** once you select a **Country**.
> - You must choose between **city**, **state**, **continent**, or **`Zip Code`** targeting and **`ASN`** targeting, as they can’t be used simultaneously.
> - Find out more [**here**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-user-pass-requests#asn-targeting).

### Session Type

  <Step title="Select session type">
    Afterward, select your preferred [**Session Type**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-session-types), **Rotating** or **Sticky**.

> 📘 Sticky Sessions
>
> - Using a sticky session, your IP will stay the same until the session expires.
>
> :warning: However, the longer the session you have, the more chances there are that **the IP will rotate before** your specified time due to the residential device at the end going offline.
>
> - Sessions of up to **24 hours** can be selected or specified from the drop-down menu in the dashboard for both **`user:pass`** and **`Whitelisted IP`** authentication methods.
> - However, the **Whitelisted IP** [**session control option**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-whitelisted-ip-requests#sticky-session) is supported only by the `HTTPS` protocol.

### Protocol

  <Step title="Choose protocol">
    Finally, choose the [**Protocol**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-protocols) format. `Endpoint:port`, `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, and `SOCKS5` options are available.
  </Step>
</Steps>

> 🚧 SOCKS5 Country Endpoint and Tool Support
>
> - `SOCKS5` [**requires advanced parameters**](https://help.decodo.com/docs/residential-proxy-protocols#socks5) to target **specific locations**.
> - To get a sticky `SOCKS5` proxy in a **tool**, you must use a `session` parameter, otherwise, the proxy will always rotate even with a `sessionduration` parameter.

## Proxy List Examples

Once you're done setting up in the Proxy Setup section, you will see a **proxy list** of generated endpoints and ports based on your selection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy or download proxy list">
    Simply **copy** it to your clipboard, or **download** a `.csv` or `.txt` file of the created proxy list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy individual parameters">
    Alternatively, **copy** single elements of the generated parameters, such as the **Proxy Address**, **Port**, **Username**, and **Password**, or copy the entire example string.
  </Step>
</Steps>

> 📘 Endpoint List Control
>
> 1. You can set the **number** of generated endpoints.
> 2. As well as how many of them you would like to display **per page** (`10`, `25`, `50`, or `100`).
> 3. Hide your password by clicking on the **eye** icon. This will not affect the copy & paste function.
> 4. Click **Switch view** at the top right under **Layout** to display the entire parameter string.
